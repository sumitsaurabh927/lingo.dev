# Dinner at Bella Vista

We finally tried the new Italian restaurant that opened last month on Main Street. Here's our honest review.

## The Atmosphere

The restaurant has a warm, inviting atmosphere with:

- **Dim lighting** that creates an intimate setting
- *Soft jazz music* playing in the background
- Fresh flowers on every table

### Making Reservations

[Book your table online](https://example.com) or call during business hours.

> Tip: Weekend reservations fill up quickly, so book ahead!

## Menu Highlights

```javascript
// Restaurant website code - not localized
function displayMenu(category) {
  const items = "This code stays in original language";
  return renderMenuItems(items);
}
```

```css
/* Styling for menu display - not localized */
.menu-item {
  color: "This CSS remains unchanged";
}
```

## Our Order

We started with the antipasto platter and house salad.

The pasta was cooked perfectly - exactly `al_dente` as it should be.

## Service Quality

The waitstaff was attentive but not overwhelming.

Our server checked on us regularly, maintaining `service.quality = "excellent"` throughout the evening.

## Final Verdict

| Course | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Appetizers | `stars(4)` |
| Main dishes | `stars(5)` |
